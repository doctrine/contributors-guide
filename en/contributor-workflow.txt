++ Who is a contributor?

A contributor can be anyone! It could be you. Continue reading this section if
you wish to get involved and contribute back to a Doctrine project.

++ Initial Setup

* Setup a [github](http://github.com) account.
* Fork the [repository](http://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2) of the project you want to contribute to.
* Clone your fork locally

-

    $ git clone git@github.com:username/doctrine2.git

* Enter the doctrine2 directory and add the **doctrine** remote

-

    $ cd doctrine2
    $ git remote add doctrine git://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2.git

* Adjust your branch to track the doctrine master remote branch, by default it'll track your origin remote's master:

-

    $ git config branch.master.remote doctrine

++ Keeping your master up-to-date!

Once all this is done, you'll be able to keep your local master up to date with
the simple command:

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull --rebase

Alternatively, you can synchronize your master from any branch with the full
fetch/rebase syntax:

    $ git fetch doctrine
    $ git rebase doctrine/master master

Using rebase pull will do a rebase instead of a merge, which will keep a linear
history with no unnecessary merge commits. It'll also rewind, apply and then
reapply your commits at the HEAD.

++ Branching Model

The following names will be used to differentiate between the different repositories:

* **doctrine** - The "official" Doctrine repository
* **origin** - Your fork of the official repository on github
* **local** - This will be your local clone of @origin@

As a **contributor** you will push your completed @local@ topic branch to @origin@.
As a **contributor** you will pull updates from @doctrine@.
As a **collaborator** (write-access) you will merge branches from contributors into @doctrine@.

++ Primary Branches

The **doctrine** repository holds the following primary branches:

* **doctrine/master** Development towards the next release.
* **doctrine/release-\*** Maintenance branches of existing releases.

These branches exist in parallel and are defined as follows:

**doctrine/master** is the branch where the source code of **HEAD** always
reflects the latest version. Each released stable version will be a tagged
commit in a **doctrine/release-\*** branch. Each released unstable version will
be a tagged commit in the **doctrine/master** branch.

> **NOTE**
> You should never commit to your forked **origin/master**. Changes to **origin/master**
> will never be merged into **doctrine/master**. All work must be done in a
> **topic branch**, which are explained below.

++ Topic Branches

Topic branches are for contributors to develop bug fixes, new features, etc. so
that they can be easily merged to **master**. They must follow a few simple rules
as listed below:

* May branch off from: **master** or a **release-\*** branch.
* Must merge back into: **master** and any affected **release-\*** branch that should get the same changes, but remember that release branches usually only get bug fixes, with rare exceptions.
* Branch naming convention: anything except **master** and **release-\***. If a topic is related to a JIRA issue then the branch should be named after that ticket, e.g. **DDC-588**

Topic branches are used to develop new features and fix reported issues. When
starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will
be incorporated may well be unknown. The essence of a topic branch is that it
exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged
back into **master** or a **release-\*** branch (to add the new feature or bugfix
to a next release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).

Topic branches should exist in your **local** and **origin** repositories only,
there is no need for them to exist in **doctrine**.

++ Working on topic branches

First create an appropriately named branch. When starting work on a new topic,
branch off from **doctrine/master** or a **doctrine/release-\*** branch:

    $ git checkout -b DDC-588 doctrine/master
    Switched to a new branch "DDC-588"

Now do some work, make some changes then commit them:

    $ git status
    $ git commit <filespec>

Next, merge or rebase your commit against **doctrine/master**. With your work
done in a **local** topic branch, you'll want to assist upstream merge by
rebasing your commits. You can either do this manually with `fetch` then `rebase`,
or use the `pull --rebase` shortcut. You may encounter merge conflicts, which you
should fix and then mark as fixed with `add`, and then continue rebasing with
`rebase --continue`. At any stage, you can abort the rebase with `rebase --abort`
unlike nasty merges which will leave files strewn everywhere.

> **CAUTION**
> Please note that once you have pushed your branch remotely you MUST NOT rebase!

    $ git fetch doctrine
    $ git rebase doctrine/master DDC-588

or (uses tracking branch shortcuts):

    $ git pull --rebase

> **CAUTION**
> You must not rebase if you have pushed your branch to **origin**.

If you need to pull master into your branch after it has already been pushed remotely, simply use:

    $ git pull

Push your branch to **origin**:

Finished topic branches should be pushed to **origin** for a **collaborator**
to review and pull into **doctrine** as appropriate:

    $ git push origin DDC-588
    To git@github.com:hobodave/doctrine2.git
        * [new branch]      DDC-588 -> DDC-588</pre>


Now you are read to send a pull request from this branch, and update JIRA,
to let a collaborator know your branch can be merged.

++ Topic Branch Cleanup

Once your work has been merged by the branch maintainer, it will no longer be
necessary to keep the local branch or remote branch, so you can remove them!

Sync your local master:

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull --rebase

Remove your local branch using -d to ensure that it has been merged by upstream.
Branch -d will not delete a branch that is not an ancestor of your current head.

From the git-branch man page:

<pre>
-d 
    Delete a branch. The branch must be fully merged in HEAD.
-D 
    Delete a branch irrespective of its merged status.
</pre>

Remove your local branch:

    $ git branch -d DDC-588

Remove your remote branch at **origin**:

    $ git push origin :DDC-588
